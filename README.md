# Adventure Game
This project is the end result of taking the Raspberry Pi foundation's OOP
class, currently located at: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles.
The "game" is a set of Python scripts and is more a demonstration of the classes that I created than a complete game.
Still, you can have a bit of fun with it!
